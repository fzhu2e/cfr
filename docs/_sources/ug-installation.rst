Installation
===============


Install the Conda environment
-----------------------------

You may skip this step if your Conda environment has been installed already.

Step 1: Download the installation script for miniconda3
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

macOS (Intel)
'''''''''''''

.. code-block:: bash

  wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

macOS (Apple Silicon)
'''''''''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: bash

  wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh

Linux
'''''
.. code-block:: bash

  wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

Step 2: Install Miniconda3
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

  chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-*.sh && ./Miniconda3-latest-*.sh

During the installation, a path :code:`<base-path>` needs to be specified as the base location of the python environment.
After the installation is done, we need to add the two lines into your shell environment (e.g., :code:`~/.bashrc` or :code:`~/.zshrc`) as below to enable the :code:`conda` package manager (remember to change :code:`<base-path>` with your real location):

.. code-block:: bash

  export PATH="<base-path>/bin:$PATH"
  . <base-path>/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

Step 3: Test your Installation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

  source ~/.bashrc  # assume you are using Bash shell
  which python  # should return a path under <base-path>
  which conda  # should return a path under <base-path>


Install `cfr`
---------------


Taking a clean installation as example, first let's create a new environment named :code:`cfr-env` via :code:`conda`

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n cfr-env python=3.13
    conda activate cfr-env

Then install some dependencies via :code:`conda`:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install jupyter notebook cartopy statsmodels pykdtree netcdf4

Once the above dependencies have been installed, simply

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cfr

and you are ready to

.. code-block:: python

    import cfr

in Python.

If you'd like to also enable the usage of more advanced Proxy System Models in addition to linear regression based models, which requires some extra dependencies, simply

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install "cfr[psm]"

and, you are ready to

.. code-block:: python

    from cfr import psm

in Python.

Similarly, if you'd like to enable the usage of the GraphEM algorithm, simply

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cython  # in case it's not installed yet
    pip install "cfr[graphem]"
